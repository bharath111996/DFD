Train a Deep Neural Network that learns the relationship between a defocussed image and the sigma map. Then obtain the depth from the sigma map.

TODO
----
1. Gather data
2. Get a network up and running
3. Iterate over the network model to improve accuracy
4. Figure out ways to find depth from sigma map with symmetric apperture
